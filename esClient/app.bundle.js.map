* @param {Number} translateN value to watch to substitute correct plural form\n * @param {String} translateContext context value, e.g. {@link doc:context Verb, Noun}\n * @description Annotates and translates text inside directive\n *\n * Full interpolation support is available in translated strings, so the following will work as expected:\n * ```js\n * <div translate>Hello {{name}}!</div>\n * ```\n *\n * You can also use custom context parameters while interpolating. This approach allows usage\n * of angular filters as well as custom logic inside your translated messages without unnecessary impact on translations.\n *\n * So for example when you have message like this:\n * ```js\n * <div translate>Last modified {{modificationDate | date:'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z'}} by {{author}}.</div>\n * ```\n * you will have it extracted in exact same version so it would look like this:\n * `Last modified {{modificationDate | date:'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z'}} by {{author}}`.\n * To start with it might be too complicated to read and handle by non technical translator. It's easy to make mistake\n * when copying format for example. Secondly if you decide to change format by some point of the project translation will broke\n * as it won't be the same string anymore.\n *\n * Instead your translator should only be concerned to place {{modificationDate}} correctly and you should have a free hand\n * to modify implementation details on how to present the results. This is how you can achieve the goal:\n * ```js\n * <div translate translate-params-modification-date=\"modificationDate | date:'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z'\">Last modified {{modificationDate}} by {{author}}.</div>\n * ```\n *\n * There's a few more things worth to point out:\n * 1. You can use as many parameters as you want. Each parameter begins with `translate-params-` followed by snake-case parameter name.\n * Each parameter will be available for interpolation in camelCase manner (just like angular directive works by default).\n * ```js\n * <div translate translate-params-my-custom-param=\"param1\" translate-params-name=\"name\">Param {{myCustomParam}} has been changed by {{name}}.</div>\n * ```\n * 2. You can rename your variables from current scope to simple ones if you like.\n * ```js\n * <div translate translate-params-date=\"veryUnintuitiveNameForDate\">Today's date is: {{date}}.</div>\n * ```\n * 3. You can use translate-params only for some interpolations. Rest would be treated as usual.\n * ```js\n * <div translate translate-params-cost=\"cost | currency\">This product: {{product}} costs {{cost}}.</div>\n * ```\n

The base Magic Search widget makes Foundation (a responsive front-end\n   * framework) specific calls in showMenu and hideMenu. In Horizon we use\n   * Bootstrap, therefore we need to override those methods.\n   *\n   * 2. Added 'facetsChanged' listener so we can notify the base Magic Search\n   * widget that new facets are available. Use this if your table has dynamic\n   * facets.\n   *\n   * 3. Due to the current inconsistencies in the APIs, where some support\n   * filtering and others do not, we wanted a way to distinguish client-side\n   * filtering (searching the visible subset) vs server-side filtering\n   * (another server filter query).\n   *\n   * To support this distinction we overrode the methods 'removeFacet' and\n   * 'initfacets' to emit a 'checkFacets' event. Implementers can add property\n   * 'isServer' to facets (what triggers the facet icon and color difference).\n   *\n   * Each table that incorporates Magic Search is responsible for adding\n   * property 'isServer' to their facets as they have the intimate knowledge\n   * of the API supplying the table data. The setting of this property needs\n   * to be done in the Magic Search supporting JavaScript for each table.\n   *\n   * Example:\n   * Set property 'isServer' on facets that you want to render as server\n   * facet (server icon, lighter grey color).

You can group multiple columns, resulting in\n   * nested grouping.\n   *\n   * In concept this feature is similar to sorting + grid footer/aggregation, it\n   * sorts the data based on the grouped columns, then creates group rows that\n   * reflect a break in the data.  Each of those group rows can have aggregations for\n   * the data within that group.\n   *\n   * This feature leverages treeBase to provide the tree functionality itself,\n   * the key thing this feature does therefore is to set treeLevels on the rows\n   * and insert the group headers.\n   *\n   * Design information:\n   * -------------------\n   *\n   * Each column will get new menu items - group by, and aggregate by.  Group by\n   * will cause this column to be sorted (if not already), and will move this column\n   * to the front of the sorted columns (i.e. grouped columns take precedence over\n   * sorted columns).  It will respect the sort order already set if there is one,\n   * and it will allow the sorting logic to change that sort order, it just forces\n   * the column to the front of the sorting.  You can group by multiple columns, the\n   * logic will add this column to the sorting after any already grouped columns.\n   *\n   * Once a grouping is defined, grouping logic is added to the rowsProcessors.  This\n   * will process the rows, identifying a break in the data value, and inserting a grouping row.\n   * Grouping rows have specific attributes on them:\n   *\n   *  - internalRow = true: tells us that this isn't a real row, so we can ignore it\n   *    from any processing that it looking at core data rows.  This is used by the core\n   *    logic (or will be one day), as it's not grouping specific\n   *  - groupHeader = true: tells us this is a groupHeader.  This is used by the grouping logic\n   *    to know if this is a groupHeader row or not\n   *\n   * Since the logic is baked into the rowsProcessors, it should get triggered whenever\n   * row order or filtering or anything like that is changed.  In order to avoid the row instantiation\n   * time, and to preserve state across invocations, we hold a cache of the rows that we created\n   * last time, and we use them again this time if we can.\n   *\n   * By default rows are collapsed, which means all data rows have their visible property\n   * set to false, and only level 0 group rows are set to visible.\n   *\n   * <br/>\n   * <br/>\n   *\n   * <div doc-module-components=\"ui.grid.grouping\"></div>\n   */\n\n  var module = angular.module('ui.grid.grouping', ['ui.grid', 'ui.grid.treeBase']);\n\n  /**\n   *  @ngdoc object\n   *  @name ui.grid.grouping.constant:uiGridGroupingConstants\n   *\n   *  @description constants available in grouping module, this includes\n   *  all the constants declared in the treeBase module (these are manually copied\n   *  as there isn't an easy way to include constants in another constants file, and\n   *  we don't want to make users include treeBase)\n   *\n   */\n  module.constant('uiGridGroupingConstants', {\n    featureName: \"grouping\",\n    rowHeaderColName: 'treeBaseRowHeaderCol',\n    EXPANDED: 'expanded',\n    COLLAPSED: 'collapsed',\n    aggregation: {\n      COUNT: 'count',\n      SUM: 'sum',\n      MAX: 'max',\n      MIN: 'min',\n      AVG: 'avg'\n    }\n  });\n\n  /**\n   *  @ngdoc service\n   *  @name ui.grid.grouping.service:uiGridGroupingService\n   *\n   *  @description Services for grouping features\n   */\n  module.service('uiGridGroupingService', ['$q', 'uiGridGroupingConstants', 'gridUtil', 'rowSorter', 'GridRow', 'gridClassFactory', 'i18nService', 'uiGridConstants', 'uiGridTreeBaseService',\n  function ($q, uiGridGroupingConstants, gridUtil, rowSorter, GridRow, gridClassFactory, i18nService, uiGridConstants, uiGridTreeBaseService) {\n\n    var service = {\n\n      initializeGrid: function (grid, $scope) {\n        uiGridTreeBaseService.initializeGrid( grid, $scope );\n\n        //add feature namespace and any properties to grid for needed\n        /**\n         *  @ngdoc object\n         *  @name ui.grid.grouping.grid:grouping\n         *\n         *  @description Grid properties and functions added for grouping\n         */\n        grid.grouping = {};\n\n        /**\n         *  @ngdoc property\n         *  @propertyOf ui.grid.grouping.grid:grouping\n         *  @name groupHeaderCache\n         *\n         *  @description Cache that holds the group header rows we created last time, we'll\n         *  reuse these next time, not least because they hold our expanded states.\n         *\n         *  We need to take care with these that they don't become a memory leak, we\n         *  create a new cache each time using the values from the old cache.

  * @ngdoc overview\n   * @name ui.grid.treeBase\n   * @description\n   *\n   * # ui.grid.treeBase\n   *\n   * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\"><strong>Beta</strong> This feature is ready for testing, but it either hasn't seen a lot of use or has some known bugs.</div>\n   *\n   * This module provides base tree handling functions that are shared by other features, notably grouping\n   * and treeView.  It provides a tree view of the data, with nodes in that\n   * tree and leaves.\n   *\n   * Design information:\n   * -------------------\n   *\n   * The raw data that is provided must come with a $$treeLevel on any non-leaf node.  Grouping will create\n   * these on all the group header rows, treeView will expect these to be set in the raw data by the user.\n   * TreeBase will run a rowsProcessor that:\n   *  - builds `treeBase.tree` out of the provided rows\n   *  - permits a recursive sort of the tree\n   *  - maintains the expand/collapse state of each node\n   *  - provides the expand/collapse all button and the expand/collapse buttons\n   *  - maintains the count of children for each node\n   *\n   * Each row is updated with a link to the tree node that represents it.  Refer {@link ui.grid.treeBase.grid:treeBase.tree tree documentation}\n   * for information.\n   *\n   *  TreeBase adds information to the rows\n   *  - treeLevel: if present and > -1 tells us the level (level 0 is the top level)\n   *  - treeNode: pointer to the node in the grid.treeBase.tree that refers\n   *    to this row, allowing us to manipulate the state\n   *\n   * Since the logic is baked into the rowsProcessors, it should get triggered whenever\n   * row order or filtering or anything like that is changed.  We recall the expanded state\n   * across invocations of the rowsProcessors by the reference to the treeNode on the individual\n   * rows.  We rebuild the tree itself quite frequently, when we do this we use the saved treeNodes to\n   * get the state, but we overwrite the other data in that treeNode.\n   *\n   * By default rows are collapsed, which means all data rows have their visible property\n   * set to false, and only level 0 group rows are set to visible.\n   *\n   * We rely on the rowsProcessors to do the actual expanding and collapsing, so we set the flags we want into\n   * grid.treeBase.tree, then call refresh.  This is because we can't easily change the visible\n   * row cache without calling the processors, and once we've built the logic into the rowProcessors we may as\n   * well use it all the time.\n   *\n   * Tree base provides sorting (on non-grouped columns).\n   *\n   * Sorting works in two passes.  The standard sorting is performed for any columns that are important to building\n   * the tree (for example, any grouped columns).  Then after the tree is built, a recursive tree sort is performed\n   * for the remaining sort columns (including the original sort) - these columns are sorted within each tree level\n   * (so all the level 1 nodes are sorted, then all the level 2 nodes within each level 1 node etc).\n   *\n   * To achieve this we make use of the `ignoreSort` property on the sort configuration.  The parent feature (treeView or grouping)\n   * must provide a rowsProcessor that runs with very low priority (typically in the 60-65 range), and that sets\n   * the `ignoreSort`on any sort that it wants to run on the tree.  TreeBase will clear the ignoreSort on all sorts - so it\n   * will turn on any sorts that haven't run.  It will then call a recursive sort on the tree.\n   *\n   * Tree base provides treeAggregation.  It checks the treeAggregation configuration on each column, and aggregates based on\n   * the logic provided as it builds the tree. Footer aggregation from the uiGrid core should not be used with treeBase aggregation,\n   * since it operates on all visible rows, as opposed to to leaf nodes only. Setting `showColumnFooter: true` will show the\n   * treeAggregations in the column footer.  Aggregation information will be collected in the format:\n   *\n   * ```\n   *   {\n   *     type: 'count',\n   *     value: 4,\n   *     label: 'count: ',\n   *     rendered: 'count: 4'\n   *   }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * A callback is provided to format the value once it is finalised (aka a valueFilter).\n   *\n   * <br/>\n   * <br/>\n   *\n   * <div doc-module-components=\"ui.grid.treeBase\"></div>\n   */\n\n  var module = angular.module('ui.grid.treeBase', ['ui.grid']);\n\n  /**\n   *  @ngdoc object\n   *  @name ui.grid.treeBase.constant:uiGridTreeBaseConstants\n   *\n   *  @description constants available in treeBase module.\n   *\n   *  These constants are manually copied into grouping and treeView,\n   *  as I haven't found a way to simply include them, and it's not worth\n   *  investing time in for something that changes very infrequently.\n   *\n   */\n  module.constant('uiGridTreeBaseConstants', {\n    featureName: \"treeBase\",\n    rowHeaderColName: 'treeBaseRowHeaderCol',\n    EXPANDED: 'expanded',\n    COLLAPSED: 'collapsed',\n    aggregation: {\n      COUNT: 'count',\n      SUM: 'sum',\n      MAX: 'max',\n      MIN: 'min',\n      AVG: 'avg'\n    }\n  });\n\n  /**\n   *  @ngdoc service\n   *  @name ui.grid.treeBase.service:uiGridTreeBaseService\n   *\n   *  @description Services for treeBase feature\n   */\n  /**\n   *  @ngdoc object\n   *  @name ui.grid.treeBase.api:ColumnDef\n   *\n   *  @description ColumnDef for tree feature, these are available to be\n   *  set using the ui-grid {@link ui.grid.class:GridOptions.columnDef gridOptions.columnDefs}\n   */\n\n  module.service('uiGridTreeBaseService', ['$q', 'uiGridTreeBaseConstants', 'gridUtil', 'GridRow', 'gridClassFactory', 'i18nService', 'uiGridConstants', 'rowSorter',\n  function ($q, uiGridTreeBaseConstants, gridUtil, GridRow, gridClassFactory, i18nService, uiGridConstants, rowSorter) {\n\n    var service = {\n\n      initializeGrid: function (grid, $scope) {\n\n        //add feature namespace and any properties to grid for needed\n        /**\n         *  @ngdoc object\n         *  @name ui.grid.treeBase.grid:treeBase\n         *\n         *  @description Grid properties and functions added for treeBase\n         */\n        grid.treeBase = {};\n\n        /**\n         *  @ngdoc property\n         *  @propertyOf ui.grid.treeBase.grid:treeBase\n         *  @name numberLevels\n         *\n         *  @description Total number of tree levels currently used, calculated by the rowsProcessor by\n         *  retaining the highest tree level it sees\n         */\n        grid.treeBase.numberLevels = 0;\n\n        /**\n         *  @ngdoc property\n         *  @propertyOf ui.grid.treeBase.grid:treeBase\n         *  @name expandAll\n         *\n         *  @description Whether or not the expandAll box is selected\n         */\n        grid.treeBase.expandAll = false;\n\n        /**\n         *  @ngdoc property\n         *  @propertyOf ui.grid.treeBase.grid:treeBase\n         *  @name tree\n         *\n         *  @description Tree represented as a nested array that holds the state of each node, along with a\n         *  pointer to the row.
